<!-- bash commands cheatsheet -->

# Bash
- Bash allows users to provide commands through which the user can specify what they want to do. Before providing the commands, bash displays a prompt, as you open the command line (in Linux and macOS), such as the one below.

    user@localhost:~$

- This prompt would typically state the current username with the hostname of the system. By default, the current directory of the terminal will be the user's root (or home) directory.

**echo**
- echo is the most basic command in bash, which displays its arguments on standard output (on the terminal).
1. user@localhost:~$ echo "Hello World!"
2. Hello World!
3. user@localhost:~$ echo Hello World!
4. Hello World!
