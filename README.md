<!-- bash commands cheatsheet -->

# Bash
- Bash allows users to provide commands through which the user can specify what they want to do. Before providing the commands, bash displays a prompt, as you open the command line (in Linux and macOS), such as the one below.

user@localhost:~$

- This prompt would typically state the current username with the hostname of the system. By default, the current directory of the terminal will be the user's root (or home) directory.
